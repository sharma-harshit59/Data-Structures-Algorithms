SOLUTION:
We are given an integer n.
We can reorder its digits in any order (including the original) but the number cannot start with 0. 
We need to determine if some reordering of n's digits can form a power of two.

1. Convert n to a string and sort its digits to form `strNum`.
2. Iterate through all powers of two from 1 up to 2^30 (≤ 1e9):
   - Convert the current power of two to a string, sort its digits, and store in `stri`.
   - If `stri` matches `strNum`, return true — a permutation of n's digits forms a power of two.
3. If no match is found after checking all powers of two, return false.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(30 × k log k) — where k is the number of digits in n (≤ 10), effectively O(1) for given constraints.
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(k) — for storing and sorting the digit strings.
