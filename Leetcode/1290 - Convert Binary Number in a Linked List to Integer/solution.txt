SOLUTION:
The linked list represents a binary number, with the head as the most significant bit.

To convert it to a decimal:
1) Initialize an integer `number = 0`
2) Traverse the list:
   - Left-shift `number` by 1 (equivalent to multiplying by 2)
   - Add the current node's value (0 or 1)
3) Return the final value

This method avoids string/array conversions and uses O(1) space.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(n) — one pass through the list  
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1) — no extra memory used
