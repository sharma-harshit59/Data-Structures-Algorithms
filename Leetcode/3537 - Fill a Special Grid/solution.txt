SOLUTION:
The goal is to construct a 2ⁿ × 2ⁿ grid filled with numbers from 0 to 2²ⁿ - 1 such that it satisfies specific hierarchical quadrant rules.
At every level, each quadrant must obey a strict ordering: Top-right < Bottom-right < Bottom-left < Top-left
And recursively, each quadrant must itself be a "special grid".
This recursive structure naturally suggests a divide-and-conquer strategy, but instead of recursion, the solution uses an iterative BFS-like simulation via a queue. This is efficient and avoids deep call stacks.

1)  Grid Initialization
    First, compute the size of the final grid (2ⁿ × 2ⁿ) and create it with placeholder values.
    A counter is initialized to track the values being placed from 0 upwards.

2)  Queue-Based Subdivision Process
    A queue is used to track the processing of subgrids. Each element in the queue contains:
        The top-right corner position of the current quadrant.
        The size (maxStep) of the current quadrant (starts with the full grid).
    
    Processing follows these steps:
        If a subgrid is of size 1 × 1, it's a base case. You place the current counter value into that cell and increment the counter.
        Otherwise, divide the current square into four quadrants of equal size:
            Top-right
            Bottom-right
            Bottom-left
            Top-left
        These are enqueued in this specific order, as it ensures that the values get assigned to each quadrant in the correct priority order.
    This order enforces the problem’s hierarchy where each quadrant will receive a contiguous block of values, and the earlier quadrants get smaller values than the later ones.

3)  Traversal Order and Number Assignment
    The traversal order (top-right → bottom-right → bottom-left → top-left) combined with the queue-based BFS traversal ensures that the value ranges assigned to quadrants maintain the proper inequalities:
        Every quadrant receives a subgrid with values strictly higher than the quadrant before it.
        This ensures that at every level of division, the quadrant constraints are satisfied.
    Since every quadrant is itself processed as a smaller grid, the recursive condition that each quadrant must also be special is inherently met.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(4ⁿ), since you're filling a 2ⁿ × 2ⁿ grid — which has 4ⁿ cells.
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: Also O(4ⁿ), due to the grid storage and the queue that processes each quadrant (though queue memory is more transient).
