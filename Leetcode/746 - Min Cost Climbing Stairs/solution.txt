SOLUTION:
We are given an array `cost` where cost[i] is the cost of stepping on the ith stair.
You can start at index 0 or 1 and move 1 or 2 steps at a time.

1. Use two variables `prev2` and `prev1` to store the minimum cost to reach the (i-2) and (i-1) steps respectively.
2. For each i from 2 to n-1:
   - Compute the cost to reach step i using: cost[i] + min(prev1, prev2)
   - Update prev2 and prev1 accordingly.
3. Finally, return min(prev1, prev2) — the cost of reaching the top from either of the last two steps.
