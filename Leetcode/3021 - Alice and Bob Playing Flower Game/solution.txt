SOLUTION:
We are given two integers n and m representing the maximum number of flowers in two lanes.  
Alice and Bob play a game where Alice wins if the total number of flowers (x + y) is odd.  
We need to count the number of pairs (x, y) such that:
    1 ≤ x ≤ n  
    1 ≤ y ≤ m  
    and (x + y) is odd.

Approach:
1) Count how many even and odd numbers are in the range [1, n]:
    - nEven = n // 2  
    - nOdd = (n + 1) // 2  
2) Do the same for [1, m]:
    - mEven = m // 2  
    - mOdd = (m + 1) // 2  
3) Alice wins if x + y is odd. That happens in two cases:
    - x is even, y is odd → nEven * mOdd  
    - x is odd, y is even → nOdd * mEven  
4) Add both counts to get the total number of valid pairs.
