SOLUTION:
To find the missing number in an array of distinct integers from the range [0, n], we use the XOR trick.

Key idea:
XOR cancels out identical numbers (a ^ a = 0), and a ^ 0 = a.
If we XOR all indices (1..n) with all values in nums, everything cancels except the missing number.

1) Initialize a result variable res = 0.

2) Traverse the array:
   - For each index i, XOR res with nums[i] and (i+1).
   - This ensures every number from 0..n and every array element is included.

3) After the loop, res will hold the missing number.

This works because all pairs cancel out except the one number missing in nums.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(n) – We traverse the array once.
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1) – Only one variable is used regardless of input size.
