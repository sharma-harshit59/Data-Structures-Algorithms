SOLUTION:
We are given a list of folder paths. A folder is a subfolder of another if the parent folder path is a prefix of it followed by a '/'. We want to remove all subfolders from the list.

Approach:
1. Sort the folder paths lexicographically. This ensures that a parent folder appears before any of its subfolders.
2. Initialize an empty result array.
3. Iterate through each folder:
   - If the current folder starts with the last folder in the result + '/', it is a subfolder — skip it.
   - Otherwise, it's a new parent folder — add to result.
4. Return the result.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(N log N) — due to sorting
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(N) — for the result array
