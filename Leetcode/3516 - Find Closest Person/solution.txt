SOLUTION:
We are asked to determine which of two people (at positions x and y) will reach a third person (at position z) first on a number line, assuming equal speed.

Approach:
1) Compute the absolute distances:
   - `distX = |z - x|`
   - `distY = |z - y|`
2) Compare distances:
   - If `distX < distY`, return 1 (Person 1 is closer).
   - If `distX > distY`, return 2 (Person 2 is closer).
   - Otherwise, return 0 (they arrive at the same time).

This method is optimal since we only need constant-time distance calculations and comparisons.
