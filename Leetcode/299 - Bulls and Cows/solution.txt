SOLUTION:
We need to return a hint string in the format "xAyB" where:
- x is the number of bulls (correct digit, correct position)
- y is the number of cows (correct digit, wrong position)

Approach:
1) Iterate through both `secret` and `guess`:
   - If characters match at the same index → it's a bull.
   - Otherwise, store frequency of mismatched digits in hash maps for both strings.

2) After the iteration:
   - For each character in `secretMap`, check if it exists in `guessMap`.
   - Add the minimum of the two counts to the `cows`.

3) Return the result as a formatted string: "bullsA(cows)B".

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(n) — Single pass for counting, and one pass over fixed digit set (at most 10).
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1) — Hash maps store at most 10 digits.
