SOLUTION:
A subsequence is valid if the parity of the sum of every two consecutive elements is the same.

Recall:
- (even + even) % 2 = 0
- (odd + odd) % 2 = 0
- (even + odd) % 2 = 1

This implies that valid subsequences can be:
  1. All odd numbers → even+even = even
  2. All even numbers → odd+odd = even
  3. Alternating even-odd or odd-even → even+odd = 1

Approach:
1) Count all odd and even numbers → these give max length for all-even or all-odd subsequence.
2) Traverse `nums`, and greedily build an alternating-parity subsequence by only selecting numbers whose parity differs from the previous one.
3) Return the maximum of these three lengths.
