SOLUTION:
    To validate a 9×9 Sudoku board, we must ensure:
    - Each row contains unique digits (excluding '.')
    - Each column contains unique digits
    - Each 3×3 sub-box contains unique digits

Approach:
We iterate through the board three times:
1) For each row:
    - Use a Set to track seen digits
    - If a duplicate is found, return False

2) For each column:
    - Use a Set to track seen digits
    - If a duplicate is found, return False

3) For each 3×3 box:
    - Identify the starting row and column using k:
        row = (3 * k) % 9
        col = Math.floor(k / 3) * 3
    - Check all 9 cells in the 3×3 sub-box for duplicates

If all checks pass, return True.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(1) — Board is fixed 9×9  
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1) — Sets store at most 9 values each pass
