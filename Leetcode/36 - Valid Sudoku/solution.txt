SOLUTION:
    To validate a 9×9 Sudoku board, we must ensure:
    - Each row contains unique digits (excluding '.')
    - Each column contains unique digits
    - Each 3×3 sub-box contains unique digits

Approach:
We iterate through the board three times:
1) For each row:
    - Use a boolean array of size 9 to track seen digits
    - If a duplicate is found, return False

2) For each column:
    - Use a boolean array of size 9 to track seen digits
    - If a duplicate is found, return False

3) For each 3×3 box:
    - Identify the starting row and column using k:
        row = Math.floor(k / 3) * 3
        col = (k % 3) * 3
    - Check all 9 cells in the 3×3 sub-box for duplicates

If all checks pass, return True.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(1) — Board is fixed 9×9  
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1) — Boolean array size is fixed at 9
