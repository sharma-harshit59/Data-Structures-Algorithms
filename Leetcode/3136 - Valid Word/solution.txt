SOLUTION:
A word is valid if:
1) It has at least 3 characters
2) It contains at least one vowel AND one consonant
3) All characters are either alphabetic or digits

Approach:
- Check word length.
- Loop through each character:
    - If it’s a letter:
        - Normalize to lowercase
        - Check whether it’s a vowel or consonant
    - If it’s a digit, continue.
    - Otherwise, return false.
- Return true only if both vowel and consonant are present.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(n) — where n is the length of the word  
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1) — uses constant extra space
