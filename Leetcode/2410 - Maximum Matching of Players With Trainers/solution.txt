SOLUTION:
We aim to match each player to a trainer such that:
  - Each player is matched to one trainer.
  - The trainer's strength is >= the player's strength.
  - Each trainer can be used at most once.

Approach:
1) Sort both players and trainers in ascending order.
2) Use two pointers (one for players, one for trainers).
3) Iterate:
    - If the current trainer can train the current player (trainer >= player),
      we match them and advance both pointers.
    - Otherwise, try the next stronger trainer.

This greedy strategy ensures the most matches, as it always assigns the weakest eligible trainer to each player.
