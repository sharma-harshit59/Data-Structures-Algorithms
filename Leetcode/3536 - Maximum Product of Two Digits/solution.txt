SOLUTION:
The task is to find the maximum product of any two digits in a given integer.
The digits can be in any order, and you can use the same digit twice only if it appears multiple times in the number.
Since the maximum number has at most 9 digits, a direct digit-level analysis is efficient and acceptable.

1)  Extract Digits One by One
    Start by iterating through each digit of the number from the least significant digit (rightmost) to the most significant (leftmost).
    This is done by:
        Taking the last digit of the number.
        Then removing it by dividing the number by 10 (and flooring the result).

2)  Track the Two Largest Digits
    As you go through each digit:
        Keep track of the largest digit found so far.
        Also track the second-largest digit found so far.
    You do this because the maximum product will always come from multiplying the two largest digits in the number.
    
    Whenever a new digit is found:
        If it's larger than the current largest, promote the current largest to second-largest, and update the largest.
        If it's not larger than the largest but greater than the current second-largest, update the second-largest.
    This keeps the two biggest digits updated in real-time as you scan through the number.

3)  Return Their Product
    After checking all digits, multiply the two largest digits and return that product.
    This is guaranteed to be the highest product possible between any two digits in the number.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(log₁₀ n), since you're iterating through the digits of the number — up to 9 digits max.
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1), only two variables are used to track the two largest digits.
