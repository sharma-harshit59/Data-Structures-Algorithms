SOLUTION:
We fill the matrix in spiral order using four boundaries:
  - top, bottom (row bounds)
  - left, right (column bounds)

At each step, we:
  1. Move left to right on the top row
  2. Move top to bottom on the right column
  3. Move right to left on the bottom row
  4. Move bottom to top on the left column

After each direction, shrink the respective boundary.

We repeat until top > bottom or left > right.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(n²) — We fill each cell once  
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(n²) — Matrix of size n×n is returned
