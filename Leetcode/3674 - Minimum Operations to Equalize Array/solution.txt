SOLUTION:
We need to make all elements of the array equal using the operation:
- Choose any subarray and replace its elements with the bitwise AND of that subarray.

Key idea:
The entire array is itself a valid subarray.  
So, in at most one operation, we can make all elements equal by taking the AND of all numbers in the array.

1) If all elements are already equal:
   - No operation is needed. Return 0.

2) Otherwise:
   - Choose the whole array as the subarray.
   - Replace all elements with the AND of the array.
   - This makes all elements equal in one operation. Return 1.

Therefore, the answer is always 0 (if uniform) or 1 (if not).

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(n) – We only check if all elements are equal.  
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1) – Only a few variables are used.
