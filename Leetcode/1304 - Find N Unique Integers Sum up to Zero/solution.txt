SOLUTION:
To generate an array of n unique integers that sum to zero, we leverage symmetry.

Key idea:
Numbers can be paired as (i, -i). Each pair adds up to zero. If n is even, we just return these pairs.  
If n is odd, we add a single 0 in addition to the pairs.

1) Initialize an empty result array.

2) For each integer i from 1 to n/2:
   - Add i to the result.
   - Add -i to the result.
   This ensures pairs balance to zero.

3) If n is odd, also add 0 to the result.

This guarantees exactly n unique numbers whose sum is zero.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(n) – We generate n numbers.  
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(n) – For the result array.
