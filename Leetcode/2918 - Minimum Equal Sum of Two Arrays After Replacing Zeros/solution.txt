SOLUTION:
The goal of the problem is to replace all the 0's in two arrays with strictly positive integers such that the total sums of both arrays become equal.
If it's not possible, return -1. Otherwise, return the minimum equal sum that can be achieved.

1)  Initialize Sum and Zero Counters
    Start by computing two things for each array:
        The current sum, treating each 0 as 1 (since replacements must be strictly positive and the minimum such value is 1).
        The count of zeros, which tells us how many values need to be replaced.
    This ensures you're preparing for the minimum possible sum each array could achieve after replacement.

2)  Simulate the Minimum Total Sum
    You treat each 0 as 1 during sum calculation to simulate the least possible increase in total.
    This gives the minimum theoretical total that the array could have once all 0s are replaced.
    So, after this step, you have the minimum possible total for nums1 and nums2.
    You also know how much room you have (via zero counts) to increase the total in each array if needed.

3)  Check for Impossibility
    There are two key cases where it's impossible to make the totals equal:
        If nums1 already has a smaller sum than nums2, but it has no zeroes to increase it, you can't make up the difference.
        Similarly, if nums2 already has a smaller sum than nums1, but it has no zeroes to increase it, you can't make up the difference.
    In either of these cases, you return -1 as it's impossible.

4)  Return the Minimum Valid Equal Sum
    If neither case of impossibility occurs, then it's possible to adjust one or both arrays (by increasing some of the 0s beyond 1) until both sums are equal.
    The minimum value you can reach in this way is the greater of the two "minimum possible totals" â€” since the smaller one can always be increased using its 0s.
    So, the result is the maximum of the two minimum totals computed earlier.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(n), since you make a single pass through each array.
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1), using only a fixed number of counters and accumulators.
