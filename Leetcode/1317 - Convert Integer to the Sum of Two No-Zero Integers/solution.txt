SOLUTION:
To split n into two No-Zero integers, we check numbers systematically.

Key idea:
We need two numbers (a, b) such that:
- a + b = n
- neither a nor b contains a digit '0'.

1) Define a helper function `isNoZero(num)`:
   - While num > 0, check the last digit.
   - If any digit is 0, return false.
   - Otherwise, continue until num = 0.
   - If no zero digits are found, return true.

2) Iterate i from 1 to n/2:
   - Let j = n - i.
   - If both i and j are No-Zero integers:
       → Return [i, j].

3) Since problem guarantees a solution exists, we will always find and return a pair.

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(n log n) – In the worst case, we check up to n/2 numbers, and each check takes O(log n) digits.

SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1) – We only use constant extra space.
