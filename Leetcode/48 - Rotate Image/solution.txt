SOLUTION:
To rotate an n x n matrix 90 degrees clockwise in-place (without extra space), we use a two-step transformation:

1) Reverse the matrix vertically:
   - Swap row i with row (n - i - 1) for i in [0, n/2)

2) Transpose the matrix:
   - Swap matrix[i][j] with matrix[j][i] for i < j
   - This flips the matrix over its diagonal

This combination results in a clockwise rotation.

Example:
Original:
1 2 3
4 5 6
7 8 9

After vertical reverse:
7 8 9
4 5 6
1 2 3

After transpose:
7 4 1
8 5 2
9 6 3

TIME-COMPLEXITY: O(n²)
SPACE-COMPLEXITY: O(1) — in-place, no extra space used
